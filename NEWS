Changes between version 2.0.1 and 2.0.0

  FEATURES
  * Plug-ins:
    - Optimisations in life game based plug-ins, and ImageEffects.
  
  MISC
  * Plug-ins:
    - Added an help panel for ShaderEffects, ShaderWebcam, GPUProgramming,
      and OCLProgramming.
  
  BUGS
  * Corrected colour shader, which didn't work with Intel GPUs.
  * Translator uses a C++ locale instead of a C one, so no more complaints from
    wzWidgets in debug builds.

Changes between version 2.0.0 and 1.3.2

  FEATURES
  * New plugin : OCLProgramming, allowing image effects using OpenCL
    kernels.
  * Generator :
    - Is now a shared library, and no more a static library.
    - Displays the configuration panel using overlays, instead of using 
      wxWidgets controls.
	- As no more dependency to wxWidgets.
    - Hence all wxThread has then be replaced by an std::thread.
	- Uses FreeType to display text overlays.
	- Generator class has been splitted in 3 classes : CpuStep, GpuStep, and
	  Generator.
	- Loads XPM images itself (for icons and buttons images).
  * Each plugin implements CpuStep, GpuStep, and Generator.
  * ProceduralGenerator : It is now a Generator plufg-ins holder, it just
    transmits mouse and keyboard events to the currently loaded generator.
  * Now uses UTF8 encoded std::string instead of std::wstring.
  * TextEffects : improved, thanks to shaders it is now rendered in one pass.
  
  MISC
  * The fullscreen switch now keeps the original image width/height ratio.
  * Reads .mo files to retrieve translations, without wxWidgets help.
  * Uses C++11 features like smart pointers (shared, weak and unique), threads,
    condition variables, atomics, lambdas, range loop for, auto, etc.
  * The status bar is now integrated to the configuration panel.


Changes between version 1.3.2 and 1.3.1

  FEATURES
  * New plugin : GPUProgramming, similar to ShaderEffects with less
    limitations : image is optional as is vertex shader.
  
  MISC
  * It is now possible to switch to fullscreen by a double click on the main
    window


Changes between version 1.3.1 and 1.3.0

  MISC
  * Now using wxSizer classes to place elements and to resize main wxindow

Changes between version 1.3.0 and 1.2.3.0

  BUGS FIXED
  * Corrected Gaussian Blur in ImageEffects plugin

  * Corrected a DiffusionLimitedAggregation crash in non square resolutions.

  * Corrected ShaderWebcam on GNU/Linux.

  MISC
  * Revised thread system : the generators now are threaded and extend also 
    wxEvtHandler.

  * Revised communication between generator and worker threads : it is done
    through events.

  * Generators and worker thread are detached threads (no more joinable).

  * Revised ConfigPanel creation : the generators now hold the structure of the
    panel, the panel is created in main application (useful on MS-Windows so no
    more trouble from memory management between DLLs and main application).

  * Revised communication between genertors and their ConfigPanel, all is now
    managed through events.

Changes between version 1.2.3.0 and 1.2.2.0

  BUGS FIXED
  * Corrected a GUI lack of response, increasing the render loop timer time.

  * Corrected a close crash

  FEATURES
  * New pluggin : ShaderWebcam, to apply GLSL shaders over a webcam video.

  MISC
  * Dropped boost/std threads, using wxThreads instead.

  * Improved texture update from ram, using 2 Pixel Buffer Objects.

  * Modified the CMakeLists.txt in order to have a binaries directory that 
    looks like GNU/Linux install

  * Modified the CMakeLists.txt to be able to install ProceduralGenerator (only
    on GNU/Linux, though)

  * Added FindOpenCV in cmake_modules folder. I have taken the one available on
    OpenCV Wiki, but

  * modified it a bit to take care of most recent versions of it.

  * Modified the management of the status update event, to be cross-platform.

  * Removed the static BufferDeclaration and BufferDeclarationElements, because
    it caused the close crash.
