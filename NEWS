Changes between version 1.3.2 and 1.3.1

  FEATURES

    limitations : image is optional as is vertex shader.
  
  MISC

    window


Changes between version 1.3.1 and 1.3.0

Changes between version 1.3.0 and 1.2.3.0

  BUGS FIXED
  * Corrected Gaussian Blur in ImageEffects plugin

  * Corrected a DiffusionLimitedAggregation crash in non square resolutions.

  * Corrected ShaderWebcam on GNU/Linux.

  MISC
  * Revised thread system : the generators now are threaded and extend also 
    wxEvtHandler.

  * Revised communication between generator and worker threads : it is done
    through events.

  * Generators and worker thread are detached threads (no more joinable).

  * Revised ConfigPanel creation : the generators now hold the structure of the
    panel, the panel is created in main application (useful on MS-Windows so no
    more trouble from memory management between DLLs and main application).

  * Revised communication between genertors and their ConfigPanel, all is now
    managed through events.

Changes between version 1.2.3.0 and 1.2.2.0

  BUGS FIXED
  * Corrected a GUI lack of response, increasing the render loop timer time.

  FEATURES
  * New pluggin : ShaderWebcam, to apply GLSL shaders over a webcam video.

  MISC
  * Dropped boost/std threads, using wxThreads instead.

  * Improved texture update from ram, using 2 Pixel Buffer Objects.

  * Modified the CMakeLists.txt in order to have a binaries directory that 
    looks like GNU/Linux install

  * Modified the CMakeLists.txt to be able to install ProceduralGenerator (only
    on GNU/Linux, though)

  * Added FindOpenCV in cmake_modules folder. I have taken the one available on
    OpenCV Wiki, but

  * modified it a bit to take care of most recent versions of it.

  * Modified the management of the status update event, to be cross-platform.

  * Removed the static BufferDeclaration and BufferDeclarationElements, because
    it caused the close crash.
