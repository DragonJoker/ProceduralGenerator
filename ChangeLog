2015-08-14  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Simplified plugins creation.
	* Finished reviewing comments.
	* Working on CPU time computation, which is erroneous.
	* Now each plugin unloads its own translations from Translator

2015-08-13  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Removed pointer to the OpenGl instance, now GlHolder holds a reference to
	*   it.
	* In GeometryBuffers, the vertex buffer is no more a pointer, and the index
	*   buffer is a unique_ptr.
	* In Overlay, the geometry buffers is no more a pointer (same in
	*   BorderPanelOverlay).
	* The controls just affect the visibility of their overlays and no more their
	*   children.
	* In the same way, when they set their overlays visibility, they use
	*   m_visible instead of IsVisible, so the overlays have the same visibility
	*   as the control.
	* Corrected colour shader, it didn't work on Intel GPUs.
	* Translator now uses a C++ locale instead of a C one, so no more complaints
	*   from wxWidgets in debug.
	* Added an help to GpuProgramming, ShaderEffects, ShaderWebcam, and
	*   OCLProcessing.

2015-08-12  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Added DefaultCpuStep and DefaultGpuStep classes, to remove the dummy ones
	*   in plug-ins.
	* Reviewed the comments.
	* Reviewed the controls creation, they take the parent in the constructor
	*   instead of the Create method.
	* Few optimisations, in Life Game based plug-ins, and ImageEffects too.
	* Adding an help panel to ShaderEffects plug-in.

2015-08-11  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Added Recorder class to remove record related stuff from RenderPanel.
	* Added a method to plug-ins: HasCustomisableResolution(), to get that
	*   status, and not having anything more based on plug-in names.
	* Removed Trace macro, using std::cerr.


2015-03-29  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* The ControlsManager is now thread-safe.
	* Added the possibility to use keyboard to move through listbox and 
	*   combobox items.
	* The CpuStep threads array is now a private member. This class provides
	*   DoForEachThread and DoForOneThread methods to apply a function to each
	*   thread or to one thread.

2015-03-17  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	*   Deactivation of a control.
	* Added a KeyboardState in ControlsManager, to memorize the status of Ctrl,
	*   Alt and Shift keys.
	* Added a new keyboard event type : eKEYBOARD_EVENT_CHAR, to handle the
	*   displayable key typed event.
	* Added m_cursor member to Control, in order to customize the mouse cursor
	*   per control type (TEXT on EditCtrl, HAND for ButtonCtrl...)
	* EditCtrl is nearly ended, just need to take care of multibyte characters
	*   when deleting them with DEL or BACKSPACE (I must use Utf8Iterator for
	*   that).
	* Finished SliderCtrl.

2015-03-11  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Added possibility to change mouse cursor when it is over a control.

	*   ImageButtonCtrl.
	* Remove event callbacks. The controls construction is eased.
	* Reviewed the way Overlays are rendered: They are first sorted by Z-Index,
	*   taking care of their place in the hierarchy (level).
	* Still need to review the combobox items visibility, in order to make the
	*   render bug free.

2015-03-06  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Corrected a bug in gl::Texture. Once resized, if Initialised was not
	*   called, the texture was always considered resized, and was always
	*   black.

2015-03-03  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Now overlays are rendered in pixels and not in ratio, so no more
	*   interpolation in the render.
	* GeometryBuffers, VertexBuffer, and Vertex are now template classes
	*   specialisations (of respectively TGeometryBuffers, TVertexBuffer, and TVertex), in order to be able change the vertex's position data type (float or int32_t).
	* Continued controls implementation, removed callbacks (except for event
	*   callbacks, I will need some of them).
	* Added possibility to change background and foreground colours (useful
	*   for sub-controls).
	* Added EventHandler, Event, MouseEvent and KeyboardEvent classes.
	* Added ControlManager class, to handle the events dispatching to
	*   appropriate controls.

	*   anymore.
	* GCC and wxWidgets 2.8 compliance.
	* Finished to implement overlays with colour materials.
	* Removed StatusBar, it is now implemented using overlays.
	* The CPU and GPU steps times are in ProceduralGenerator. RenderPanel just
	*   retrieves them to update the status bar.
	* Added a Render method to ProceduralGenerator.
	* Worked on render loop, nearly ended.
	* Just need to correct few bugs, I think the rendered buffer is the back
	*   buffer instead of front buffer.
	* The GPU step is on the GUI thread and the CPU step is in another thread.
	* The two steps are fired using a timer on the render panel.
	* Corrected DoRender function for PanelOverlay and BorderPanelOverlay.
	* Still working on TextOverlay.

	*   objects using initializer_lists if available, or using the traditional
	*   constructors if not available.
	* Corrected Font bugs.
	* Added text overlays shader programs, which add a sampler with the text
	*   texture.
	* Implementing the overlays that will display the CPU and GPU times.
